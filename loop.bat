Shot from a low angle, the cheetah's body is close to the ground, its muscles flowing, and its limbs alternately and powerfully step over stones and soil, stirring up dust. The cheetah's eyes are sharp, staring at the target in front of it, showing unparalleled speed and strength. The camera follows the cheetah's running trajectory, capturing every moment of leaping and turning, showing its amazing agility. The whole scene unfolds in a tense chase rhythm, full of wild charm and competition for survival."
